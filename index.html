<div class="content">
  Dear Mahi,<br>
I hope this letter finds you in the midst of a quiet moment with your favorite satire.<br>
<br>
It's my way of saying <b>I see you</b>, and I admire the spark you bring to everything. First, I know relationships aren't on your radar right now, and I respect that completely. Life's phases are temporary, and I'm not here to rush.<br>
<br>
That said, <b>I do like you—a lot</b>. Not in a way that demands anything, but in the quiet way that makes me want to know more about the real you. The stories behind your Lucknow-Delhi roots, the chaos of your study breaks, your preference, your likes and dislikes, or even the simple things like what makes a perfect plate of momos for you (steamed, fried, or that spicy tandoori twist?).<br>
<br>
If our friendship had a constitution, I would keep it simple<br>
<br>
Article 1- No pressure<br>
Article 2- Extra teekhi chutney allowed<br>
Article 3- Feelings can be expressed, never imposed<br>
Article 4- Freedom first, connection second, it's ur choice<br>
<br>
No deadlines, no expectations, just pure intention<br>
<br>
I’m <b>not here to complicate your life</b>. If friendship is all this ever becomes, I’d still consider that lucky.<br>
<br>
If this little letter makes you smile even a tiny bit, or if you ever feel like sharing a momo recommendation, a random thought, or just venting—I'm right here, no schemes, just sincere.<br>
<br>
Whether this becomes a conversation, a friendship, or just a quiet page on the internet , I’m glad I wrote it.<br>
<br>
Nexda (or whatever silly name you want to call me )<br>
<br>
P.S. Extra teekhi chutney wale momos on me if we ever chat. Deal?
